### Volunteering

_Campaign to Re-elect Kshama Sawant_

Volunteering for the campaign required door-knocking and phone-banking. Data entry was something that I also helped out with, and preferred to door-knocking and phone-banking.

_EMP Museum_

As a volunteer at the EMP Museum, I worked as crowd control and answering questions that museum guests had. It exposed me to the world of art, popular culture, and even technology. 

### Education

**Seattle Central College** / January 2016-present

3.54 GPA. Coursework has included introduction to information technology, which required a lot of self-teaching of programming languages on codeacademy.com. Languages I took the liberty in learning included mySQL, Python, and HTML + CSS. This course also introduced us to the fundamentals of Github and collaboration. We also had a week of discussing women in tech. Taking introduction to computer science in the fall, which will give me a more in-depth look at Python.

**Seattle University** / _Creative Writing_ / September 2014-December 2015

3.5 GPA. Took a course called "introduction to GIS," which taught me some basics of mySQL. This course is what made me want to change my career path.

**Bellevue College** / _Associates in English_ / April 2012-June 2014

3.50 GPA. Coursework included statistics, astronomy, environmental science, and gender in the social world. Participated in Running Start April 2012-June 2013.

**Mt. Si High School** / September 2009-June 2013

3.2 GPA. Coursework included photography, graphic design, journalism, and honors language arts. Received an above average score on the PSAT math section, and was invited to enroll in AP Computer Science. However, at the time, it wasn't of much interest to me. Looking back, I wish I had explored the field at an earlier age after receiving that invitation.
